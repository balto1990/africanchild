  <h1>What we do</h1>

    <p>Helping children off the streets and into school gives them a chance to improve their lives and build a better future.</p>

    <h3>WHAT OUR PROJECTS MEAN</h3>
      <p>13-year-old Agnes is a pupil at Ng'ate Primary School in Thika, Kenya, and receives a daily mug of porridge through one of our Porridge Club schemes.</p>
      <p><i>"On behalf of the pupils of Ng'ate Primary School, I would like to thank you for the porridge feeding programme in our school. Our pupils are healthier than other children in the community. We are learning more quickly because we are not hungry and hardly ever have a day off school anymore. The porridge gives us the energy to run and learn. THANK YOU!"</i></p>
